<h1>About</h1>

<h2>A little about me...</h2>

<p>I'm Ryan Chipman.</p>

<p>I am a Course Six (Computer Science) major at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and plan to graduate in the spring of 2016.</p>

<p>While I still have a lot of learning and experience ahead of me, I am currently very interested in both web and mobile development, and the potential those platforms have, both individually and together, to affect the way we interact with information, with each other, and with the world around us.</p>

<p>Outside of the classroom, I am an avid musician and outdoorsman. I am a self-taught guitarist, and sing with the <a href="http://mitlogs.com" target="_blank">MIT Logarhythms</a>. I earned my Eagle Scout with Troop 80 of Norfolk, MA, and still love to travel north to the white mountains for weekend backpacking trips.</p>

<p>Whether you're interested in <a href="/projects">seeing my work</a> or just learning a little <a href="/interests">more about me</a>, you've come to the right place!</p>
